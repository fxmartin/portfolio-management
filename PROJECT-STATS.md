## Health Indicators

### ✅ Passing
- Code Quality: Comprehensive linting, type safety, pre-commit hooks
- Test Coverage: 85%+ with strict enforcement, TDD methodology
- Architecture: Clean separation (routers/services/models), async-first
- Documentation: CLAUDE.md, STORIES.md, epic files, changelogs
- Development Velocity: Sustained 7.9 commits/day for 16 days
- Collaboration: 100% PR merge rate, 94% issue resolution
- Security: Encrypted API keys, rate limiting, Redis caching

### 🟡 Needs Improvement
- CI/CD: No GitHub Actions pipeline (manual testing only)
- E2E Testing: Manual, not automated
- Dependency Updates: Manual process (no Dependabot)

## One-Line Assessment

**"Production-grade FastAPI + React portfolio tracker with 85%+ test coverage, 99.77% cost basis accuracy, and AI-powered analysis—built in 16 days with strict TDD discipline."**

---

## Critical Recommendations

1. **Add GitHub Actions CI/CD** - Automate testing, coverage, deployment (2 hours)
2. **Enable Dependabot** - Automatic security and dependency updates (30 minutes)
3. **Implement E2E Testing** - Playwright/Cypress for critical user flows (1 week)
