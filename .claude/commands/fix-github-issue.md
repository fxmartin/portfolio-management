# Fix GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS
# Expected: $ARGUMENTS = issue-number OR issue-url OR "next" for highest priority

## VALIDATION & SAFETY
- Verify `gh auth status` - ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated
- Parse $ARGUMENTS to extract issue number
- Run `gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --json state,assignees,labels,title,body`
- STOP if issue is: closed, assigned to someone else, or labeled as "wontfix"
- STOP if issue lacks reproduction steps or clear acceptance criteria

## ISSUE ANALYSIS
1. Extract issue details: title, description, labels, reproduction steps
2. Assess complexity based on labels (bug/enhancement/security/etc.)
3. Check for linked PRs or related issues using `gh issue list --search "mentions:#$ISSUE_NUMBER"`
4. Identify if this relates to existing stories/epics in STORIES.md
5. **COMPLEXITY GATE**: If high complexity, prompt for confirmation before proceeding

## CODEBASE INVESTIGATION
6. Search for relevant files using issue keywords and error messages
   - Priority 1: Files mentioned in issue description
   - Priority 2: Error stack traces and file paths
   - Priority 3: Related components based on issue type
7. Analyze current test coverage for affected areas
8. Review recent commits touching the same files (`git log --oneline -n 10 -- $FILES`)

## DEVELOPMENT PHASE (DEFENSIVE)
9. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b fix/issue-$ISSUE_NUMBER`
10. **Reproduce the bug first** - create failing test that demonstrates the issue
11. **Document the fix approach** - comment your strategy before coding
12. **Implement minimal fix** - smallest change that resolves the issue
13. **Add defensive tests** - edge cases, regression prevention
14. **Run comprehensive validation**:
    - All tests pass: `pytest` / `npm test`
    - Linting clean: `ruff check` / `eslint`
    - Type checking: `mypy` / `tsc --noEmit`
    - **Manual verification** of the original reproduction steps

## INTEGRATION & DELIVERY
15. **Update documentation** if the fix changes behavior
16. **Link to stories**: Update STORIES.md if this issue relates to an epic
17. **Commit with context**:
```
    fix: resolve [issue type] in [component] (#$ISSUE_NUMBER)

    - [Brief description of root cause]
    - [Brief description of fix]
    - [Any breaking changes or notes]

    Fixes #$ISSUE_NUMBER
```
18. **Push and create PR**: `gh pr create --title "Fix: [issue title]" --body "Closes #$ISSUE_NUMBER"`
19. **Auto-link**: Ensure PR description includes "Closes #$ISSUE_NUMBER"

## ERROR HANDLING & SAFEGUARDS
- **If reproduction fails**: Comment on issue asking for clarification
- **If fix is too complex**: Break into subtasks and update issue
- **If tests break other features**: Revert and reassess approach
- **If linting fails**: Auto-fix what's possible, report manual fixes needed
- **If no clear fix path**: Document investigation findings and ask for guidance

## SMART BOUNDARIES
- **Time limit**: If investigation takes >30min, document findings and pause
- **Scope creep**: Fix ONLY the reported issue, note related improvements separately
- **Breaking changes**: Require explicit confirmation before proceeding

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Always provide:
- Issue summary and fix approach
- Files modified and test coverage added
- Verification that original reproduction steps now pass
- PR link and any follow-up actions needed
- Time spent and complexity assessment
